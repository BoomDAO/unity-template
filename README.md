## UNITY TEMPLATE

This **Unity Template** has all the necessary code for integration with the **World Protocol** on the Internet Computer blockchain. Features include on-chain login authentication, payments, minting, burning, action system, entity datastore, white-label shop, and white-label NFT marketplace. We designed this template to streamline the blockchain game-building process, so that game developers can focus on crafting fun and enjoyable gameplay. 

Deploy a game **World** canister using our [Game Launcher](launcher.boomdao.xyz) website, configure your World's rules directly from the website, download this Unity Template and edit it to call your World canister. Boom. You now have a fully on-chain game.
